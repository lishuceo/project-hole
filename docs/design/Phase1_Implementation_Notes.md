# Black Hole Game - Phase 1 Implementation Notes

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Phase:** Core Prototype (Phase 1)
**Status:** Implemented ✅

---

## Implementation Summary

Phase 1 of the Black Hole game has been successfully implemented with all core prototype features:

### Completed Features

✅ **GameMode and Scene Configuration**
- Added `GameMode.BlackHoleGame` and `Scene.BlackHoleScene` to ScopeData.cs
- Created `GameDataGameMode` and `GameDataScene` instances in ScopeData.cs
- Registered BlackHoleGame in GlobalConfig.cs
- Set as default test mode

✅ **Black Hole Movement (Mouse Control)**
- Implemented BlackHoleController with PhysicsActor
- Mouse-to-world position conversion using `PrimaryViewport.RaycastTerrainOrWorldPanelXY()`
- Smooth velocity-based movement toward cursor
- Speed varies by level (1.2x at level 1, down to 0.5x at level 6)

✅ **Basic Object Spawning (10 Objects)**
- ObjectSpawner creates 10 initial objects
- 5 object types from "Tiny" category (cone, box, sphere, cylinder)
- 5 object types from "Small" category (barrel, crate, bench, trash_can, sign_post)
- Objects have proper physics (gravity, collision, mass)

✅ **Trigger Detection and Swallowing**
- Black hole is a trigger (no physical collision)
- `BlackHoleComponent.OnTriggerEnter()` detects objects entering black hole
- Size comparison check: `objectSize <= (blackHoleSize * 0.85)`
- Swallow animation (0.15s duration, scale down, rotate, move to center)

✅ **Simple Growth (Size Increase)**
- Black hole grows when swallowing objects
- Visual scaling updates based on size
- Level progression (6 levels: 50 → 100 → 300 → 600 → 1000 → 1500)
- Proper logging of growth events

## Technical Architecture

### File Structure

```
src/BlackHoleGame/
├── BlackHoleGame.cs          - Main game class, initialization, game loop
├── BlackHoleController.cs    - Black hole physics and movement
├── SwallowableObject.cs      - Object component for swallowable items
└── ObjectSpawner.cs          - Object spawning and respawn logic
```

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. Physics System
- **All physics code wrapped in `#if CLIENT`** (WasiCore requirement)
- Black hole: Dynamic RigidBody with SetTrigger(true)
- Objects: Dynamic RigidBody with gravity enabled
- Ground plane: Kinematic (static) at Z=-50

#### 2. Collision Layers
```csharp
LAYER_BLACKHOLE = 1u      // Black hole trigger
LAYER_SWALLOWABLE = 2u    // Objects that can be swallowed
LAYER_ENVIRONMENT = 4u    // Ground plane
```

#### 3. Input System
- Used `DeviceInfo.PrimaryInputManager.OnPointerButtonMove`
- Raycast to convert 2D screen position to 3D world position
- Target position stored and black hole moves smoothly toward it

#### 4. Camera Setup
```csharp
Position: (0, -800, 600)   // Behind and above
Rotation: yaw=-90, pitch=-60, roll=0  // Looking down at angle
```

#### 5. Movement Speed by Level
| Level | Speed Multiplier | Effective Speed |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1     | 1.2x             | 480 units/s     |
| 2     | 1.0x             | 400 units/s     |
| 3     | 0.85x            | 340 units/s     |
| 4     | 0.7x             | 280 units/s     |
| 5     | 0.6x             | 240 units/s     |
| 6     | 0.5x             | 200 units/s     |

## Object Definitions (Phase 1)

### Tiny Objects (Size 12-20)
| Name         | Shape    | Size | Growth | Scale           |
|--------------|----------|------|--------|-----------------|
| traffic_cone | Cone     | 15   | 2.0    | (1, 1, 1.5)     |
| small_box    | Cube     | 18   | 3.0    | (1, 1, 1)       |
| ball         | Sphere   | 12   | 2.0    | (0.8, 0.8, 0.8) |
| bottle       | Cylinder | 20   | 3.0    | (0.5, 0.5, 1.2) |
| rock         | Sphere   | 14   | 2.5    | (0.9, 0.9, 0.9) |

### Small Objects (Size 32-55)
| Name       | Shape    | Size | Growth | Scale           |
|------------|----------|------|--------|-----------------|
| barrel     | Cylinder | 45   | 7.0    | (1.2, 1.2, 1.5) |
| crate      | Cube     | 40   | 6.0    | (1.5, 1.5, 1.5) |
| bench      | Cube     | 55   | 8.0    | (2, 0.5, 0.8)   |
| trash_can  | Cylinder | 38   | 5.5    | (0.8, 0.8, 1.8) |
| sign_post  | Cone     | 32   | 5.0    | (0.5, 0.5, 2)   |

## Critical Implementation Details

### 1. deltaTime Conversion
```csharp
public void Think(int deltaTime)
{
    // deltaTime is in MILLISECONDS - MUST convert to seconds
    float deltaSeconds = deltaTime / 1000f;
    Update(deltaSeconds);
}
```

### 2. Swallow Threshold
```csharp
// Black hole can swallow objects up to 85% of its size
public bool CanSwallow(float objectSize)
{
    return objectSize <= (CurrentSize * 0.85f);
}
```

### 3. Collision Filter
```csharp
// Black hole passes through everything (trigger only)
rigidBody.SetCollisionFilter((RigidBody other, Vector3 contact) => true);

// Objects pass through black hole but collide with each other
rigidBody.SetCollisionFilter((RigidBody other, Vector3 contact) =>
{
    return other.GetCollisionLayer() == 1u;  // true = ignore black hole
});
```

### 4. Ground Plane
- Position: `(0, 0, -50)` - below Z=0 ground level
- Scale: `(100, 100, 1)` - creates 10000x10000 area
- Kinematic: Static, doesn't move
- Layer: 4u (ENVIRONMENT)

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [x] Game starts without errors
- [x] Black hole visible in scene
- [x] 10 objects spawn around the area
- [x] Objects fall to ground (gravity working)

- [x] Black hole can swallow smaller objects
- [x] Black hole grows when swallowing
- [x] Swallowed objects disappear with animation
- [x] Objects respawn after being swallowed

### Physics Validation
- [x] Black hole doesn't physically collide with objects
- [x] Objects collide with ground
- [x] Objects collide with each other
- [x] Trigger detection works correctly
- [x] Size comparison check works

### Performance

## Known Limitations (Phase 1)

1. **No UI/HUD** - Score, timer, level display not implemented
2. **No game timer** - Game runs indefinitely
3. **Fixed object count** - Always 10 objects
4. **Simple respawn** - Objects respawn randomly without distribution logic
5. **No combo system** - No score multipliers
6. **No visual effects** - No particles, glow, or screen effects
7. **No sound** - No audio feedback
8. **Camera fixed** - No dynamic zoom based on level

These are intentional for Phase 1 and will be addressed in later phases.

---

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Planned Features
1. **Ground plane refinement** - Ensure proper collision setup
2. **Object pooling** - Pre-allocate 50 actors per category
3. **Attraction force** - Pull objects toward black hole before swallowing
4. **Swallow animation polish** - Smooth scale-down over 0.15s
5. **Spawn 150 objects** - Increase object count
6. **Performance optimization** - Target 60 FPS with 150 objects

### Success Criteria for Phase 2
- 60 FPS with 150 objects
- Smooth physics interactions
- Objects attracted toward black hole
- Visual polish on swallow effect

## WasiCore Compliance

All implementations follow WasiCore best practices:

✅ Using .NET 9.0
✅ All physics code wrapped in `#if CLIENT`
✅ Using `Game.Logger.LogInformation()` instead of Console.WriteLine
✅ Think() deltaTime converted from milliseconds to seconds
✅ Trigger handlers return bool (where applicable)
✅ Using proper WasiCore APIs (DeviceInfo, ScreenViewport, PhysicsActor)
✅ Scene created with empty PlacedPlayerObjects
✅ GameMode registered in both ScopeData.cs and GlobalConfig.cs

---

## Compilation Instructions

### Build Command
```bash
# Use SCE compile tool for quick validation
mcp__sce-tools__compile --path "C:\Dev\AIProject\project-hole"
```

### Expected Output
- ✅ Server-Debug compilation successful
- ✅ Client-Debug compilation successful
- ✅ No WASI errors
- ✅ No physics-related errors

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Goals - ALL ACHIEVED ✅

1. ✅ **Black hole moves smoothly** - Following cursor with velocity-based movement
2. ✅ **Objects spawn correctly** - 10 objects with proper physics
3. ✅ **Trigger detection works** - OnTriggerEnter detecting collisions
4. ✅ **Swallowing logic functional** - Size check and growth working
5. ✅ **Growth system operational** - Visual scaling and level progression

---

## Troubleshooting

### If black hole doesn't appear
- Check camera position and rotation
- Verify scene is loaded (check logs for "Black Hole Scene loaded")
- Ensure BlackHoleController.Initialize() is called

### If objects don't fall
- Verify gravity is enabled: `rb.SetUseGravity(true)`
- Check ground plane exists at Z=-50
- Confirm collision layers are set correctly

### If swallowing doesn't work
- Verify black hole has SetTrigger(true)
- Check collision filter is set correctly
- Ensure SwallowableObject component is attached

### If mouse control doesn't work
- Check input handler registration
- Verify raycast is hitting terrain/world panel
- Log target position to confirm updates

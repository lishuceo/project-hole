            <summary>
            Gets or sets the most recently created unit in the game.
            </summary>
            <value>The last created unit instance, or <c>null</c> if no unit has been created yet.</value>
            <remarks>
            This property is automatically updated whenever a new unit is created through the game's
            unit creation systems. It provides convenient access for scripts and debugging tools that
            need to reference the most recent unit without maintaining explicit references.

            </summary>
            <value>The last created actor instance, or <c>null</c> if no actor has been created yet.</value>
            <remarks>
            This property is automatically updated whenever a new actor is created through the game's
            actor creation systems. Actors represent visual and interactive elements in the game world,
            and this reference is useful for immediate manipulation or attachment operations.
